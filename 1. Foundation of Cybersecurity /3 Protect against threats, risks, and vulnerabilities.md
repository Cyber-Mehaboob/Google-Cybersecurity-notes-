- **Purpose**: They provide a structured approach to identifying, assessing, and managing cybersecurity risks and Protecting PII, securing financial Information. Frameworks typically offer a high-level view of what needs to be done to achieve cybersecurity objectives.
 
- **Examples**:
  1. NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
  2. ISO/IEC 27001.

## Security controls
- **Definition**: Security controls are specific measures, safeguards, or countermeasures implemented within an organization to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and systems.

- -**Purpose**: Controls are the actual tools, processes, or policies implemented to enforce security policies and guidelines outlined by the framework.
  
- **Examples**:
  1. Access controls (e.g., authentication mechanisms).
  2. encryption mechanisms
  3. Firewalls
  4. Intrusion detection systems, and incident response procedures.

*For example,Organizations typically adopt a security framework to guide their overall security strategy. Within that framework, they select and implement specific controls based on their risk assessments and compliance requirements*.

## CIA triad (foundational model)
**It is a foundational principle that is designed to guide the policies for information security**.

- **Confidentiality** - Only authorized users can access specific assets or data.
- **Integrity** - Data can not be altered in any unauthorized manner. data is correct, authentic and reliable.
- **Availability** - Data is always accessible to those who are authorized to access it.
