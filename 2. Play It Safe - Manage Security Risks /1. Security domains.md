## CISSP's 8 security domains (SASCISSS)

- **1. Security goals and risk management**: It focuses on,
   - Defining security goals and objectives
   - Risk mitigation
   - Compliance
   - Business continuity
   - Legal regulations
     
- **2. Asset security**: It focuses on,
   - Security digital & physical assets
   - Storage, maintenance, retention, destruction of data
   - Policies and procedures for the above
     
- **3. Security architecture and engineering**: It focuses on,
   - Ensure effective tools / systems / processes are in place to protect assets & data
   - Shared responsibility: All individuals in an org take active role in lowering risk and maintaining security
     
- **4. Communication & network security**: It focuses on,
   - Managing & securing physical networks / wireless communications.
     
- **5. Identity & access management (IAM)**: It focuses on,
   - Identification (verify who they are e.g. username)
   - Authentication (verify their identity e.g. password / PIN)
   - Authorization (verify access)
   - Accountability (log actions)
     
- **5. Security assessment & testing**: It focuses on,
   - Security control testing
   - Collecting & analysing data
   - Conducting security audits
     
- **6. Security operations**: It focuses on,
   - Conducting investigations
   - Preventative measures
 
- **7. Software development security** : It focuses on,
   - Secure coding practices

## Threats, risks, and vulnerabilities

## Threats

**Threat** : A threat is any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets.
   - **Insider threats**: Staff members or vendors abuse their authorized access to obtain data that may harm an organization.
   - **Advanced persistent threats (APTs)**: A threat actor maintains unauthorized access to a system for an extended period of time.

## Risks

**RISKS** : A risk is anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset.

- **Levels of risk**:
  - **Low-risk asset**: Assets that will not effect the organization's reputation and no financial damage.
  - **Medium-risk asset**: It may cause organization's finances and reputation.
  - **High-risk asset**: Protected by regulations / laws. e.g. PII, SPII.
    
- **Common risk categories**:
  - **Internal threats**: Employees, contractors, or insiders with unauthorized access.
  - **External threats**: Hackers, malware, phishing attacks, and social engineering.
  - **Natural disasters**: Fires, floods, earthquakes, and power outages.
  - **Technical failures**: Hardware or software malfunctions.
    
    
**RISK HANDELING** :

- **Risk identification** : Identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities that could compromise an organization's assets, ops.
- **Risk assessment** : Identifying, analyzing and priortizing risks to organization's assets and operations.
    
  - **Qualitative risk assessment**: Uses subjective judgments and expert opinions to assess risks.
  - **Quantitative risk assessment**: Uses numerical data and statistical analysis to quantify risks.


- **Risks Priortization** : Priortizing risks based on their likelihood and impact.
- **Risk Tolerance** : Risk tolerance is the level of risk an organization is willing to accept.
      
- **Risk Treatment** : It is the process of taking best action to address identified and priortized risks.
  - **Risk Avoidance** : Completely removing the asset or activity that poses the risk.
  - **Risk Acceptance** : Tolerate the risk and taking no-actions reduce the risk.This is often considered when the cost of mitigation outweighs the potential loss.
  - **Risk Mitigation** : Implementing security controls to reduce the likelihood or impact of the risk.
  - **Risk Transfer** : Transfer the risk to a third party, often through insurance or outsourcing.

## Vulnerabilities

**Vulnerabilities** : vulnerability is a gap or weakness in a system or organizations that can be exploited by a threat. Eg. :

  - **Software vulnerabilities**: Bugs or errors in software code that can be exploited to execute malicious code.
  - **Hardware vulnerabilities**: Weaknesses in hardware components that can be exploited to compromise system security.
  - **Network vulnerabilities**: Misconfigurations or weaknesses in network infrastructure that can be used to gain unauthorized access. Â 
  - **Human vulnerabilities**: Errors or mistakes made by users or administrators that can lead to security breaches.
