## Security frameworks


Security frameworks are comprehensive sets of guidelines, best practices, and standards designed to help organizations establish, implement, and maintain effective cybersecurity programs.

### 1. NIS Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 

It provides a flexible approach consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk - **IPDRR**

 - 1.**Identify** : Identifying critical assets, threats, and vulnerabilities.
 - 2.**Protect** :  Implementing security controls to protect assets from threats.
 - 3.**Detect** :  Identifying indicators of compromise and detecting potential attacks.
 - 4.**Respond** : This outlines steps to take in response to a security incident.
 - 5.**Recover** : Recovering from an incident and restoring normal operations.

### 2. ISO/IEC 27001 (International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission)

- **ISO/IEC 27001**  is an internationally recognized standard that specifies requirements for an information security management system (ISMS). It provides a structured approach to managing information security risks.

  

## Security controls

Security controls are specific measures, safeguards, or countermeasures implemented within an organization to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and systems.

### Categories of Security Controls:

- **Administrative Controls:**
  - Access control policies - Preventative
  - Least Privilege - Preventative
  - Incident response plans - Preventative
  - Employee training programs - Preventative
- **Technical Controls:**
  - Firewalls - Preventative
  - IDS / IPS - Detective
  - Antivirus software - Corrective
  - Encryption - Deterence
- **Physical Controls :**
  - Security guards - Preventative/Detective
  - Closed-circuit television (CCTV), Motion detectors - Preventative/Detective
  - Physical barriers (Gates, fences, and locks) - Deterrent/Preventative
  - Access cards or badges readers to enter office spaces - Preventative
    
### Types of Security Controls:

**1. Preventative** : Prevent an incident from occurring.

**2. Corrective** : Restore an asset after an incident.

**3. Detective** : To determine whether an incident has occurred or is in progress.

**4. Deterrent** : To discourage attacks.


## Security principles

### OWASP = "Open Worldwide Application Security Project"
 - **Minimize attack surface area**: Attack surface refers to all the potential vulnerabilities a threat actor could exploit.

 - **Principle of least privilege**: Users have the least amount of access required to perform their everyday tasks.

 - **Defense in depth**: Organizations should have varying security controls that mitigate risks and threats.

 - **Separation of duties**: Critical actions should rely on multiple people, each of whom follow the principle of least privilege. 

 - **Keep security simple**: Avoid unnecessarily complicated solutions. Complexity makes security difficult. 

 - **Fix security issues correctly**: When security incidents occur, identify the root cause, contain the impact, identify vulnerabilities, and conduct tests to ensure that remediation is successful.
   

## Security audits

An examination of an organization's security controls, policies,procedures and compliance with security standards.

**Purpose** : security audits are conducted to assess and evaluate the effectiveness of an organization's security posture, including controls, policies, and adherence to industry standards or regulations.

### Types of Security Audits:

- **Internal audits**: Conducted by the organization's own security team or internal auditors.
- **External audits**: Conducted by independent third-party auditors.
- **Regulatory audits**: Conducted by government agencies or industry regulators to ensure compliance with specific requirements.

### Elements of securit audits : 

- Establishing scope and goals
- Conducting risk assessment
- Conducting controls assessment
- Assessing compliance
- Communicating results
